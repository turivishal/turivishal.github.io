Hello, I'm a software developer, I specialize in server-side scripting languages, especially Node.js, PHP, though I am familiar with several languages and frameworks. Previously I worked with Ionic and Angular.js. I absolutely love to learn new languages and technologies—recent favorites include Python and MongoDB Database.

I’ve also worked on Microservices based architecture for API development, focusing on the MongoDB for DBA and Python.
